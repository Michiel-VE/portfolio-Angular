      "paragraph1": "I'm a 22-year-old student interested in IT and everything to do with programming. That's why I chose to study Applied Informatics at Thomas More Geel. Just writing a program form scratch based on the needs of a friend, parent or client, is the thing I like the most.",
      "paragraph2": "And now I try to expand my knowledge even more: My goal is to study in Finland where I hope to improve my cyber-security skills. The reason why is that I wanted to continue learning but also fell in love with the country and mentality.",
      "paragraph3": "Of course programming is not the only thing I do. My hobby is judo and here I can really be myself. Our club has a great community where everybody tries to help each other and every other year we will do a quiz to challenge each other."
